### 2048 Game in Java (CLI)
A 4x4 game board represented by a 2D array and the winning value will be set to 2048.
## Game Rules
- The game board is a 4x4 grid.
- Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid.
- If two tiles of the same number collide, they merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles.
- The goal is to reach the tile with the value of 2048.
## Gameplay
- Use the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys to move the tiles up, left, down, and right, respectively.
- After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will be randomly generated in an empty spot on the board.
- The game ends when the board is full and there are no more possible moves.
